                    lies a world of adventure and wonder. This is a journey through some of the most 
                    breathtaking river canyons in the United States. From the legendary Salmon River, known 
                    as the 'River of No Return,' to the remote beauty of Desolation Canyon in Utah, and 
                    finally, to the iconic Grand Canyon in Arizona, each of these canyons tells a unique 
                    story of nature's raw power and timeless beauty. Join us as we explore these majestic 
                    landscapes, where rapids challenge the brave, wildlife roams free, and history is etched

                <h1>Main Fork of the Salmon River, Idaho</h1>
                <img src="images/salmon-boat-beach.jpg" alt=" Salmon River">
                <p>Nestled deep in the Frank Church Wilderness of No Return winds the Salmon river. The 
                    Salmon was given the nickname long ago as the River of No Return by the people living 
                    near it because of the number of folks that came to visit and fell so in love with the 
                    rugged beauty of the river that they never left.</p>
                <p>Herds of elk and deer graze on the hillsides around the river and bear and bighorn sheep 
                    are also commonly sighted. The river corridor is also lined with awe inspiring ponderosa 
                    pine which tower over the sandy beaches in the campsites and provide shelter from sun or 
                    rain when needed.</p>
                <p>Let's not forget the rapids! They range from class I-IV. The Salmon is one of the longest 
                    undammed rivers in the United States. As a free flowing river the water is higher, faster, 
                    and colder in the early summer and lower, slower, and warmer in the late summer. There are 
                    good rapids all summer...but families with children who like to swim tend to appreciate the 
                    late summer's slower, warmer water more.</p>

                <h1>Desolation and Gray Canyon, Utah</h1>
                <img src="images/rafting11_1024.jpg" alt="Gray Canyo, Utah">
                <p>Winding through canyons in central Utah, in some of the most desolate land anywhere, the 
                    Green river flows towards the mighty Colorado river and the sea. High grey stone cliffs, 
                    beautiful desert scenery, and great rapids have made this run famous. This 84-mile trip 
                    runs from from Sand Wash to Swaseys Rapid (just outside Green River Utah) and boasts 
                    outstanding scenery, interesting geologic formations, evidence of prehistoric and 
                    historic human activity, and great whitewater opportunities.</p>
                <p>Desolation is rated a Class II/III and is usually done in 6 days</p>
                <p>Desolation Canyon has been recognized as a National Landmark.  This designation is based 
                    on the uniqueness and rich history that the canyon tells.</p>

                <h1>Grand Canyon, Arizona</h1>
                <img src="images/littlecolorado.jpg" alt="Grand Canyon, Arizona">
                <p>This is the grand daddy of all canyons and the grand daddy of all river trips. You will 
                    never forget your visit to the Grand Canyon.</p>
                <p>Grand Canyon river rafting combines world-class whitewater with breathtaking scenery to 
                    make one truly unforgettable river experience. The canyon is filled not only with 
                    exhilarating whitewater rapids, but with side canyons and ancient indian ruins 
                    accessible only by river.</p>
                <p>CLASS I - X: The Grand Canyon uses a unique river rating scale. The rapids in the Canyon 
                    are technically rated I - X ( 1 - 10) to accommodate such a wide variety of rapids and 
                    river variances. However, most people are familiar with the regular I - V river rating 
                    scale, so we often refer to both.</p>
